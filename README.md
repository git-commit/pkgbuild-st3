# PKGBUILD tools for Sublime Text 2
A bunch of random stuff (seriously)hacked together to make PKGBUILDing more  pleasant.

## Included:

 - tmLanguage (Basically ripped and modified Generic Shell)
 - Build system (clean makepkg build)
 - Plugin to provide in-app command interface:
    - Namcap PKGBUILD validation - `namcap_check`
    - MD5 generation - `makepkg_gen`
    - Source packaging - `makepkg_src`
 - Snippets

## Install:
Place PKGBUILD folder in Packages/ dir
